 <h2>Pratt is the executive chairman of Australia's biggest private company, Visy Asia-Pacific, a packaging and recycling business.</h2>

 <br>The company was set up by his grandfather in 1948 in Melbourne and expanded by his late father, Richard.<br>

<p>He also owns Atlanta's Pratt Industries, the biggest U.S. manufacturer of corrugated cardboard.</p><br>

<p> His sisters Heloise Pratt and Fiona Geminder also hold stakes in Visy and are fellow billionaires.</p>


The meeting was in Melbourne at the Visy headquarters in Freshwater Place, Southbank, where the reception desk is made of corrugated cardboard and the hanging privacy screens are recycled plastic and PET bottles.</p>


<p>Leon’s request didn’t entirely surprise his parents. Pratt, himself, is the third generation of the Visy Industries empire. His grandfather Leon started it with one factory in Footscray, which his father, Richard, grew into one of the country’s most profitable private businesses, valued at $5.5 billion in 2009. In the 10 years since, Anthony Pratt has more than doubled that fortune by expanding into the United States – one paper mill in Macon, Georgia, has grown into 70 factories in 27 states. In 2019, he tops the Financial Review Rich List with net wealth of $15.57 billion.</p>
